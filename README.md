# Sales-Dynamics
This project is a comprehensive analysis developed as part of the Microsoft Power
BI Desktop for Business Intelligence course on Udemy. It showcases the ability to
transform complex datasets into insightful visualizations and dashboards, focusing
on sales performance, customer metrics, and product analysis. The dashboard features an executive overview, allowing users to navigate through
various pages, including detailed insights on product performance, customer
demographics, and geographic sales distribution. Utilizing advanced DAX
calculations and interactive elements, the project highlights key metrics such as
total orders, revenue, and profit, while enabling drill-through capabilities for in- depth analysis. Through this project, I have demonstrated the skills acquired in the course,
including data modeling, visualization techniques, and the creation of dynamic
reports that facilitate data-driven decision-making.
